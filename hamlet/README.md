# HaMLET
This package holds the code we used for the HaMLET project. There are 3 main sub-packages--`attribution`, `modeling`, and `tools`--along with a number of top-level scripts that go from extracting images from DICOM files all the way through modeling and inference. The sub-packages have their own README files, but for more information on the scripts, please see below.
